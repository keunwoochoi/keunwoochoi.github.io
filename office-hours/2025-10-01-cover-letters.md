# Office Hours — Cover letters: how important and how long?

I had a short conversation about cover letters, paraphrased below:


Q: Some applications ask for an optional typed cover letter. I think of it as a one‑page note—why I’m applying and how I can contribute. How important is it in general? Is it more or less important for ML roles? If I’ve already met someone at a conference, do reviewers still read it? It’s “optional,” so should I still include one? Even if my experience isn’t a perfect fit, should I use it to say I can ramp up? It suddenly feels more important than I thought.

Keunwoo: Think of it as a quick “hello” in the screening process. It doesn’t need to be long. In my experience, shorter is better: your interests, why you’re applying, and any useful timeline context. As in real life, some reviewers will read it and some won’t. But if you need to advocate for yourself and haven’t already had a conversation or a referral, it can be your only channel.

Q: Got it—so not an essay. More like things I want to convey beyond the CV. I’ve seen videos claiming a great cover letter can land the job, so does it need heavy polishing? A friend says it’s basically a couple of extra sentences beyond the CV’s “About.” Which is closer to the truth?

Keunwoo: Reviewers go through many applications. We rarely read cover letters in depth—and sometimes we don’t open them. Still, write it as if it might be read. From the hiring side, I do want to see whether a candidate genuinely cares about this specific role; the cover letter is a straightforward place to signal that.
