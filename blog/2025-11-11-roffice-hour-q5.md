# Roffice Hour Q5: On Music as a Domain Being Too Small

> Music as a domain seems / is too small.

Yes, it is small. But how small is small? 

I'd say it was definitely small compared to the enthusiasm we have, as a community. You know, we like *sounds* -- we actually like it, the abstract perception of it. How many people do you know that simply likes.. *texts*? So perhaps music is analogous to reading literatures. 

More specifically, the music research industry is pretty small. See how large ISMIR is - it has ~100 papers papers and now ~500 attendees.

So why are we then doing this.. Why are you doing it? That's because you like music. Why do you like music? There's no good explanation but something too fundamental and abstract but perhaps not wrong. We're just born with it, some good ears, some sensitivity to sounds. Thats our auditory system which is pretty much decided by our genes. Yeah we're just, in some sense, *unlucky*.

But we're also lucky compared to our (or your) previous generation. Having started my masters on applied acoustics in 2009 & my PhD in music AI in 2014, I've seen many other folks in my gneration who left music right after finishing their grad school. Almost no one continued their careers in music research, because there was almost no job at all. They did other things: they did data engineering, audio chips, mobile phones, etc. 

The world has changed in an accelerated way that surprised me. That means I was too conservative. I only thought of research, industry, and business opportunities that I knew based on what I had observed. Now I learned when it's time for change, the world adds a whole new dimension, some of which turned out to be musical. And I don't know, there might be more things to do than the supply of music researchers. 

So, yes it's small. I can't naively encourage you keep working on music without worrying about it. I even ended up leaving the music industry 3 years ago! But hopefully my answer helps you understand what are other latent variables you may consider.
