# Roffice Hour Q1.1: PhD vs. Industry

## Students

Visiting a university lab has been such fun, immediately after I left university & sold my soul to the dark side aka the industry. I feel something real - real mission and passion, as well as real concerns and worries. Checking out their desks, they exude their life so well; full of random things! Random keyboards, plush animals and non-animals, old boxes, sticky notes, and whatever beyond my imagination.

The realness makes it energizing to simply talk to them. That's why I volunteered to meet with the students in the [Audio Information Research (AIR) Lab in University of Rochester](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/).

I ran a group office hour for ~1.5 hours. I've done something similar at [National Taiwan University, Yi-Hsuan Yang's lab](https://affige.github.io), and of course my dearest [MAC Lab at KAIST](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/~juhan/). Each visit is interesting. The circumstances such as the academic / industrial landscapes are different, students are different, and so am I. In this post, I'd like to share the perspectives I shared at Rochester last week.

## The Office Hour

Each of them shared with me a concern or a question, as you can(not very well) see on the whiteboard, as follows:

- 1. As a master student, should I do a PhD (in Europe? in the US?) or find a job [which seems to be able to provide the same research opportunity possibly maybe]?
- 2. How can I unify multiple projects for my PhD thesis [when they're a bit too diverse]?
- 3. What did you do when you started the PhD, or even before, when you're starting a new field / topic?
- 4. General advice on finding jobs and internships?
- 5. Music as a domain seems / is too small.
- 6. MIR became boring to me, after working in a company for some years and doing this PhD program. What should I do?
- 7. Why did you move around between companies so much?

See? I told you they're so real. And here's my thought, re-thought and re-phrased.


### Q1. Doing a PhD [in EU/US] vs. Job in industry

This has been a recurring question at least in the last 10 years in ML, which validates the importance. Let me separate this into two questions.

#### Q1.1 PhD vs. Industry**

You have to adjust the selection bias. Surely there are people who really achieved a lot, such as papers in top conferences and impactful products, perhaps even first-authored, while getting paid $$$$$$. 

But they are outliers. In reality, PhD programs and companies are totally different, unlike the impression you get when you see some papers published from industry. 

- **Growth**: No matter how you feel chased during a PhD program, you're there to take your time (years indeed) and grow. You don't have to prove yourself before getting in, or within a quarter or two. I know the bar to get accepted to a PhD program is higher these days, but my point is not about how high or low the bar to join. The bar to graduate is way, way higher than the bar to start a PhD program! Conversely, companies hire people, expecting them to perform at a certain level immediately. They hire to *use* you, and that's your price (salary). As a hiring manager, I tried my best to take potential into account too, but it was very challenging. It's risky, and it's tough to convince others too. 

- **Novelty and Uncertainty**: Academia values novelty, companies value money. In university, you're surrounded by people who're working on uncertain problems, and you even have to pursue uncertainties; otherwise your paper will be rejected due to lack of novelty. It goes on for 4-5 years. After then, you become so good at uncertainty handling. You don't even notice it because you're comfortable with it. In companies, no no no, they need you to work on something (business-)impactful ASAP, and you have to deliver something refined. Surely there are research positions, but they prefer someone who has already handled uncertainties very well (re: "growth"). And who are those people? PhD grads.

- **Papers Picking Performance**: A lot of engineers in industry would mostly read and implement some ideas from papers, while not publishing much. So you may ask: Why do I need to spend 5 years writing papers? That's a because reading, writing, and reviewing other papers (and 4-5 years of them) train you to pick the right paper among the hundreds of thousands of papers published every year. There are other ways, too. But those necessary steps in grad schools are a proven way, especially the writing part. While writing, refining, re-submitting, and publishing the paper, you go through not only the bright side but also the dark sides of papers. You have to bullshit a bit, you have to imply something, you feel lazy about some details, your paper was originally rejected and you indeed agreed but somehow a re-submission worked out, and so on. In the process, you naturally build a radar. 

- **Freedom for Topics**: Anyone would understand this & how important it is. When some papers were out from industry labs, chances are the authors happen to be told to work on something that also happened to be okay to publish and good/novel enough to publish. If they could skip some of these probabilities, they're being lucky, but no one knows how long it will last.

- **Supervision**: You have a PhD supervisor or two or three, and their job is to.. supervise you! They have other duties too, and in reality you might feel you get very little. But on average, you learn from them, hopefully a lot. In a company, your manager's job is to supervise you so that you can do your job ASAP. Typically, they wouldn't spend much time supervising you on the research decisions or writing.
