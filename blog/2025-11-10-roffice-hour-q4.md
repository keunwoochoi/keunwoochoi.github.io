# Roffice Hour Q4: Internships - Worth it?

The original question was:
> General advice on finding jobs and internships?

But what could I say anything generalizeable about jobs? There's no way I could predict my career when I was in school. So I'll focus on internships.

## 1.

DO IT!

You'll be back to school anyway, and otherwise you'll be only staying in the school for the whole year. Don't let yourself be constantly surrounded by the same environment that gives you the same kinds of feedback. Companies are different, and you're going to have a steep learning curve at the beginning just because of (thanks to) the difference.

## 2.

Let's assume it's possible to align all the companies providing internships and all the candidates applying for them reasonably well. So you're at somewhere in this line.

**Scenario 1**: You'd want to have nice names in your CV, so you look up. But they want to hire someone great, so they look up too. And oops it's a hirer's market since there are more students than companies. So you decided not to accept the offers you have, because they're not the companies above you. Next year, you have one more or two more papers (nice) and that put you higher on the line. So you look up. Now, the companies you looked up are actually below you, and they offer you a position, and you don't join because they're not above you. OK and then next year, ...

**Scenario 2**: Since it's your first time applying and you're in the early stage of PhD, you're not fully satisfied with the offers you have. You still join one, get connected with people in the industry, and they're different from your supervisor, although that wouldn't get your paper immediately accepted to next year's NeurIPS. You also learned a tiny bit about how to write code in the monorepo of the team. Next year, you score better on the programming interview and so on, and so forth.

Choose your scenario! Of course I omitted the pros of the Scenario 1 - you'd be saving time by not joining a company you're not fully satisfied about. But, I don't know, hey it's just 3 months, and as a sort of popular company hopper myself (uh oh), such an experience with a low commitment sounds great!

It's not that there's only one right answer to this question. Please take this as one of many perspectives.
