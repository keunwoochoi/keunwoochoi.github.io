# Roffice Hour Q6: MIR Becoming Boring to Me

> MIR became boring to me, after working in a company for some years and doing this PhD program. What should I do?

Unlike other posts, I'll try to direct quote my answer.

"I understand. I felt the same, I might still feel the same. From some point, most of the ISMIR papers started to be abstracted away (by me, for sure) as 'ah we chose this problem and this model and trained it and it kinda works'. I spend less and less time on the poster session during ISMIR.

Yes, you can take a look on other things. I started to work on LLMs about 3 years ago, and I really enjoyed learning something new especially at the beginning. The learning brought me back to the music research problems I've worked on TalkPlay, because I still care. It may or may not be your case, and either is fine."
