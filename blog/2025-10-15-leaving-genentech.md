Yes, I left Genentech, which is..

## Genentech / Roche

Genentech is a big US pharmaceutical company (~15,000 employees) fully owned by an even bigger pharma company called Roche. Roche has 100k+ employees and was founded in 1896. Yes! It was a 126-year-old company when I joined, and now it is 129 years old. To be fair, I was also quite precisely 2 years and 7 months younger when I joined Genentech.

## Why I joined Genentech?

In late 2022, on Twitter. People mentioned a lot about this thing called "ChatGPT". Ah crap, yeah some hype, some cool stuff — there are way too many latest AI things and I can't try out everything. This time, it was so annoying that I thought of muting the word. I was probably too lazy to even mute a keyword though, and this one lasted for more than others; it seemed to pass the test of time (of a couple of weeks). Ok, I gave it a shot, and damn, DAAAAAMMNN. 

I panicked. 

As a 14-year-long music/audio × ML person, I felt threatened. After getting a PhD, I had been extrapolating my career, not making any drastic changes to my comfort zone. Those days are over, I thought, and I met my supervisor and friend [Kyunghyun](https://kyunghyuncho.me), who turned out to be building an LLM team in Genentech. After checking some slides and a quick look at a doc that was too long for a quick look, well, I was sold. 

I joined Genentech in March 2023, because I had to learn LLMs, and i) I learn the best by doing, and ii) (IMO) anyone would learn the best by working on LLMs rather than reading and thinking. I needed such a position, and somehow this position existed! -- Well, not just somehow, but because Genentech was also motivated by ChatGPT. It was still early days of LLMs, and I guess, knowing me pretty well, Kyunghyun had some confidence in hiring me. 


## What did I do?

Besides anything [REDACTED]-worthy, hm. I joined as a founding member of the LLM team. Early 2023 was so fun. Nothing was set — no OKR, no nothing — long-term planning is close to impossible when you don't know what will be possible in the short term. Llama 1 was just out, PILE was alive as *the* dataset, Alpaca was embarrassingly not-so-clean, A100s were shiny. A lot of hacking—hacking the training code, deployment, packages—as well as the whole planning, meetings, and presentations.

2024 was brutal. New models were out, and we were tasked with something pretty difficult in many aspects. I was focused a lot on growing the team, too. Hiring turned out to be really, really challenging. But I appreciate it all -- that I was in a lucky position as a leader of a growing team, to go through so many resumes, 1:1s, interviews, offers, with some rejections. This experience made me see through this game of the job market, and I like that my position in the game was not purely advantageous, for which I had to think hard. 

2025 required another set of strategic decisions. I struggled a bit, but I was able to find a great direction for the team. This time, we all were thinking hard together, and to me, the whole process of decision-making, planning, and executing was deeply rewarding. 

## Why did I leave?

I left Genentech because the marginal amount of learning was decreasing.

I have no regrets about this decision. Things look good, and I would still leave—so I did. Actually, it feels much better to leave when things are not bad, as it completes the journey much more nicely. 


## What am I doing?

I'm simply enjoying the current status of zero commitment! I talk to a lot of people in various industries / start-ups. I allocate more time to working with KAIST folks. I'm programming even more than before, and it's so nice to have a whole day for anything I'm excited about! And in general, a lot more of [TalkPlay](https://talkpl.ai), [Hayoung Lyou ❤️](https://www.hayounglyou.com), books, Diablo 2 Resurrected, workouts, music. This sabbatical has a price tag, and it's not cheap because for now, I can only estimate the opportunity cost. But its value is being defined by myself, just like the stats and the skill tree of my amazing Sorceress; therefore, I'm trying my best. Please wish me good luck!
