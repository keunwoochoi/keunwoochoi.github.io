# Roffice Hour Q1.2: Doing a PhD in Europe vs. US 

## Scope

On this question, I'll only focus on two aspects of the decisions: i) on getting a [ML] job [in US] and ii) 3-year without the qualifying exam (how lovely!) vs. 5-year after taking GRE (ewww!)

### On getting a ML job in US

If you're very good, it doesn't matter. If you're very not good, it also doesn't matter. Thanks god, let's reduce it down to the average case, as it often should be.

There's actually a difference, no matter how everything is remote, online, and accessible. **The chance is not equal!!** And that's generally true in any business/industry topics. Companies, hiring managers, investors, .. their job is NOT give you all the same opportunities. Their job is to maximize their benefit given limited resources (like, time). Most of the time, they just need one or few people who are avobe a standard, instead of the top N candidate worldwide.

That's the value of actual proximity in the real, physical world, that's why startup founders still move to the Bay Area, and that's why US companies hire more interns from the US; and hire more full-time employees from the US. It's just always easier, especially when the baseline (i.e. the case of non-US students) is non-referred, inbound application or cold emails. 

There's also administrative reason which I had no idea during the first years of my PhD program in London. If you didn't know about OPT visa, study it. This makes a significant difference in hiring interns. THe company simply has to put more time and money in hiring interns outside of US. I've failed convincing the HR, too.

### Duration

I think European PhD programs are indeed shorter than the US ones on average. That said, there's a caveat.

Say, there's a 4-year PhD program.. or programme in Europe. What does it mean? If the program..me starts on 2025/10/01 (or.. 01/10/2025 🇪🇺)

- (a) you graduate by 2029/09/30
- (b) you submit the thesis by 2029/09/30
- (c) you're not paid after 2029/09/30

The answer -- it depends. (Did you know that it depends on circumstances?)

(a) might be what you've expected. And it seems like that's the US definition, too. Though that still doesn't mean you're guaranteed to graduate by then; it's just what it means.

(b) can be the case if it's Europe. Mine was like that too.

(c) can be also true, along with or without (b). Yes the "4" in the "4-year PhD programme simply, fundamentally, surprisingly incidates the duration of the funding source!

### Still it can be shorter, therfore better?

I thought so, and it was indeed shorter, and that was great. Yay!

But there's a catch. I only realized when I was applying for jobs. That was about 3 years after I started my PhD program. And um, as the same, PhD grads, I was competing with others, who have spent 4-5 years in their PhD program! 

I mean, nothing's fair and therefore everything is fair. But you know, the first year of PhD can just pass so quickly, and you often publish a lot more in the last year. So, in terms of your academic achievements, 4 years vs. 5 years might mean a lot of differences. 

At the end, everything is fair because that's what you chose: less time spent in the grad school in your life. But you should know every aspect of it.


### So why did you choose QMUL/UK for the PhD

A plenty of reasons!

- I didn't know any of these implications. I already had done my master in Korea & worked in a company for 3+ years. So for me, saving time was important.
- Learning English was already a significant goal, while doing my PhD. So definitely didn't consider other countries in Europe.
- TBH, IELTS is way easier than TOEFL. And..
- UK universites usually don't require GRE!!!!!!! 

But then I realized about the US visa thing. It even required me to be in New York and talk to the students and post-docs in NYU to realize I should consider the visa to get a job.

And that's also when I realized the power of proximity. Just because I was visiting NYU, I could get in touch with Spotify people; and back then, the MIR team at Spotify was perhaps only in New York. And I gave a talk about my ISMIR/ICASSP papers about music tagging, in a fairly casual, Lunch & Learn presentation. And then they asked me if I'd be interested in an internship. um... wow!! I was the same person, they could read my papers already (and some of them might have done it.) Still, there were barriers, which I happened to unblock by just being there and giving a talk.

### And other differences
- The source of research funds is usually local (per country) or continental (e.g. European research.. something), but not global. They have different interests and timelines. This may affects your PhD funding. 
- US universities almost always require PhD students taking some classes. EU ones may not do it at all. 

These are pretty much all I know now. Don't forget, the intra-class variance can be pretty big, so make sure you look into these details for your opportunities. 

Good luck, on making decisions and getting old!
