# Chairing ISMIR 2025

What is [ISMIR](https://ismir.net)? Well, it is the International Society of Music Information Retrieval, and its annual conference, where a bunch of music enthusiasts who can usually use computers in a slightly specialized way gather. 

But what is ISMIR to me?

## 2010: A "how to read this" conference

As a master's student in my second year, I was heavily involved in the paper downloading activity, ranked by the interestingness of the titles. There was perhaps a mapping like this in my brain:

```
{
    "AES Convention": "perhaps comprehensible (which was over-estimation). i like the font.",
    "AES Conference": "kinda long but perhaps comprehensible (also not really).",
    "IEEE TSALP": "why is it so long also i don't understand",
    "ICASSP": "short but i still don't get it because i don't like equations",
    "WASPAA": "workshop..? is workshop a conference or not?",
    "NIPS": "oh the format i saw from the NMF paper",
}
```

Perhaps because my colleagues [Seokjin](https://aaalab.knu.ac.kr) and Sanga were interested in music transcription papers, I ended up adding another entry to the table.

```
new_entry = {
    "ISMIR": "..how do i read this? what is a symposium? " + "WOW THE PAPERS LOOK SO INTERESTING" + "(well, i also don't understand these)"
}
```

## 2013: this is so unfair! (it was not) what the hell is a validation set? (ok that's why)

My paper was rejected by ISMIR 2013. Oh, and ISMIR 2012, too. I forgot which was about which, but one thing was clear: my paper was rejected for an allegedly unfair and incomprehensible reason: a lack of a train-validation split. Since my brain indeed lacked such an allegedly unimportant concept, I thought that was ridiculous. Though, I was probably somehow convinced, since it was one of my motivations to study [Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) with my friend [Taejin Park](https://tango4j.github.io) (whose blog post I highly recommend you read right now).

Oh I perhaps still didn't know how to pronounce ISMIR.

## 2015: my first ISMIR!

The great [ISMIR 2015](https://ismir2015.ismir.net) was held in Malaga, Spain. Malaga was amazing for sure, but my first ISMIR left an even stronger impression on me. The nervous moments during my first presentation about [listening to convnets](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZrqdSu4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=ZrqdSu4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC) at the ISMIR late-breaking/demo session, when I met my research idol [Brian McFee](https://brianmcfee.net) in real life for the first time at the banquet, when he took a picture of the QR code (or the GitHub URL?) of my poster, the jealousy of those who had a full paper, and meeting many other people, jamming together at the jam session, which made all of us so sad when they had to stop it at midnight.

It was perhaps my 13th month as a PhD student. It was well worth the years of waiting. Damn, it was so good, so fun. I really wanted to attend more. 

So addictive.

## 2016-2023

I was successfully addicted to ISMIR. While finishing my PhD, working at Spotify/ByteDance/Gaudio, or even working in a pharmaceutical company, I managed to attend every year. I presented [a huge selfie](https://youtu.be/PukmAPiH9do?si=IKLbJcYbAdU1Bd18&t=9), I reviewed papers, jammed with my friends and colleagues, grabbed beers and everything else. I served as a session chair and a tutorial chair. I served as the newcomers' squad leader, and met some people who said there are like three people in their country working in MIR; that made me feel like my 2010 in South Korea (and I wouldn't count as one). I ran an ISMIR quiz in Bangalore, which was stormed by [Geoffroy Peeters](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gpeeters/index.html) since he knew everything I knew about ISMIR. I argued about how to run the conference, I ranted, I gave tutorials, I received an award, I saw people come and go. I became a member of the society at heart. 

## 2024

Then it happened that [Prof. Juhan Nam](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/~juhan/) asked me to join ISMIR 2025 as a General Co-Chair, during ISMIR 2024. Oh no. 

Oh no, I was calling myself a traitor of MIR as I had started working on LLMs in the pharmaceutical industry. And oh no, it would be a lot of work. Also oh no, I live in New York but the conference will be in Korea. 

But oh no, it's Juhan, one of the most gracious and warm-hearted researchers, who impressed me deeply by his CV when I was still an undergrad, who really cares about the research community and his students, with the General Co-Chair being [Dasaem](https://jdasam.github.io), who exudes the same spirit. So oh no, I can't say no to these guys.

## 2025

![General Co-Chairs of ISMIR 2025](blog/img/ismir2025/ismir2025.jpg)

I really under-worked compared to Juhan and Dasaem. It was probably justified among us implicitly as I was remote from Korea and my main job is not in academia. Still, I wish I worked harder for a simple reason: I wish it felt more rewarding when the conference was done. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely rewarding, just as much as how nervous and exhausted I was during the conference. But my exhaustion was time-boxed to two weeks, whereas other general chairs and the local organizers were truly devoted, only to provide the best experience in the first ISMIR in Korea. With that in mind, let me share some remarks.

### Test-of-Time Awards

As I presented (while forgetting I was wearing my hairband) in the video below, ISMIR introduced its first Test-of-Time award in 2024. In 2024, the committee awarded one paper from ISMIR 2000–2004, while I thought we should "normalize" it to a 10-year cycle.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7oS8ZGyKhA?si=6bhjJpD_hnGSBfeF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My solution is to run it in two tracks -- *Classical* ToT for the older days, and *10-year* ToT for the 10-year old papers -- until 2027, when we will award the 2012–2014 papers as Classical ToT and finish the track.

### Jam Session

What is the Jam Session in ISMIR conferences? We all know what it is like, but we didn't have a mission statement of it -- which would define why and how we do it. Surely we could run it for about 10 years without a mission statement, but I believe the lack of a mission statement became an issue when we had to deal with conflicts. For example, why do we (implicitly and apparently) prefer bands over solo performances?

That's why this year's Jam Session hosts, [Zachary Novack](https://zacharynovack.github.io) and [Sebastian Stober](https://sebastianstober.de), and I worked on this first ISMIR Jam Session Mission Statement.

> The ISMIR jam session celebrates music that connects us all. Rooted in the interdisciplinary and inclusive spirit of the ISMIR community, we aim to not only share the joy of creating music together as artists and performers, but also provide an enriching and diverse experience for all attendees.

I hope this statement continues to be shared and accepted by the future attendees and organizers, as well as to evolve over time.

### Jamming

You know, I can't really say I've attended ISMIR too many times. But it's totally fair to say I've jammed too many times at ISMIR jam sessions, and I try to give others a chance to be on the stage as much as possible. But it was absolutely amazing to play Beyonce's *Love on Top* and Girls' Generation's [*Into the New World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I) as an opening team. 

Later in the session, I was somehow hired to play once more ... with people I've never met before (which is what a jam session is about) to play Bollywood music!!!

### Lunch and Coffee

I'm stealing the local chairs and organizers' thunder by writing this section. We provide lunch every day, and make coffee available anytime, from 9 am to 6 pm. As an attendee, I found it ridiculous that a lot of conferences limit attendees from getting coffee except during designated break times. Why..? I can imagine some reasons for sure, but I don't find any of them compelling enough. This was perhaps unanimously agreed by the organizers, which makes sense given Koreans' obsession with coffee, especially [iced americano](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-03-15/why/Iced-iced-baby-Why-cold-americanos-are-a-yearround-staple/2262099) aka the *Koreano*. Anyway, that's what we did and we're proud of it.

### Traditional Korean Music Performance

Now I'm stealing another General Co-Chair Dasaem's thunder by mentioning this, so please take it as a note as an attendee. This band "Baraji" completely blew my mind as well as others'. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wzGxrl8vF-U?si=EiSim6WZvdYHGNFE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I still listen to the playlist Dasaem created after the conference. Also available in [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/kr/playlist/baraji-ismir2025/pl.u-76oNlPmIqyA4Wd).

### Knowledge Sharing for the Future Conferences

During the preparation, the organizers communicated over Slack, Google Docs, and emails. I gathered those materials as much as possible, dumped them into a folder, and let an LLM write a guide for each chair. The result is shared in [GitHub: how-to-organize-ismir](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/how-to-organize-ismir). There was quite a bit of hallucination, largely due to my lazy prompting. Thankfully the chairs made corrections, which seemed to be a nice feature of hallucination since it must be too annoying to see some complete BS in their area.

Over the year, too many decisions were made without clear reference to the previous years. We had some materials and transfers, but that was absolutely not enough! I think this form -- an open-source GitHub repo with markdown docs -- would serve much better, well, though we shall see how it goes. I also tried to make the docs have a clear timeline of action items.

[Kyunghyun](https://kyunghyuncho.me) was right. Everyone wants a successful conference anyway, so they are all helpful and forgiving. Nevertheless, organizers don't need to be stressed out on this level. Hopefully, having this repo alleviates the issue and I will be very happy about it. 

## Closing Remark

I'll finish with sharing [other attendees' reflections on ISMIR 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23ismir2025&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=mBO). They're perhaps the top 1% most wholesome content on that platform; please check them out if you'd like to feel ISMIR at heart.
