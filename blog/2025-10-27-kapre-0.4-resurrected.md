## Kapre

Kapre means *K*eras *A*udio *Pre*processors; a bunch of Keras layers.

It was the first audio-focused Python package for deep learning. Um, I just realized it's about 9 years old. It was extremely useful to me during my PhD days, and I published a [ICML workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05781) about it, too.

Things have changed quickly. I haven't used Keras for years (and wow I don't even do audio deep learning research much.) It had been severely outdated. But, look, look at this -

Kapre 0.4.0 is out!

**Changes**: 
  - all the broken unit tests were fixed
  - the code is modernized

This is it.. yes, this is it. Nothing much different on its functionalities. But I guess this vibe-coded update will make Kapre slightly more usable for the Keras users.

Happy `pip install kapre`!
