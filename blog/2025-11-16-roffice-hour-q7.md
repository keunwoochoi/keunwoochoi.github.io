# Roffice Hour Q7: Moving Between Companies

> Why did you move around between companies so much?

Haha, I've thought of this too. You know, every time it's a greed decoding and therefore it was pretty simple.

## Spotify

I wanted to join Spotify 2014-2017, interviewed early 2018, joined mid 2018.

I hardly knew what is like working in a big tech company in the US. The team just wen through a re-org, so it was in a different organization from what I heard during the interview. I had little idea about what I was supposed to do, since I couldn't figure out what *we* were supposed to do. So, well, I worked on [DrummerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03697).

And I received a slightly below-average year-end review. Outrageous! Ridiculous! Weird! (Haha) that made me want to receive a good review. The team also worked in a more organized fashion in 2019. I was also able to work on the topic I really wanted - to improve the audio embeddings for the recommendation. 

In 2020, I was sort of wrapping up the project, and I realized that I don't know what to work on next, after exhausting all the slightly possible ideas I could come up with in 2019. I.e. I didn't think Spotify needed me anymore. So I left. 

## ByteDance

After moving to ByteDance, I got what I was missing. Works, interns, promotion, a raise, the green card. 

I was happy making contributions to the team on various aspects while training different music classification models. I could hire Minz, Jesse, and Seungheon as my interns. The team published 4 papers in the next year's ISMIR. I.e. I feel in demand, and that was good.

But the demand comes with a cost. Sometimes, I couldn't understnad the way the work was organized. Internal competition was so real in ByteDance, and that put unnecessary pressures, which trickled down as unreasonable asks. I truly got what I was missing - they started to need me too much, even on a topic I didn't think is meaningful; or on the way I didn't think we should follow.

Around the end of 2021, I wanted to grow as a research manager. But that didn't happen, and some factors like the cultural difference didn't help. Instead, my responsibility would continue training and finetuning the same model to meet the bar that was changing literally everyday; that seemed like the glass ceiling (or any sort of structure) I was perhaps touching.

I realized, even if the team was gradually growing, I failed to convince the company to bet on me as as a manager. Perhaps it was a fair decision for them. But I still wanted it, so - I left. 

## Gaudio

It was a lot of fun working in Gaudio. I was managing a small team working on multiple topics in audio and music. Now I think the learning process to become a manager includes realizing when I am needed, and back then, I didn't even fully figure this out. Gaudio was a 7-yr old startup in Korea, and it had a mixed culture of early startups as well as a mature company. I tried my best to influence them in the positive way.

After enjoying a year, I decided to leave for a few reasons. Putting aside the difficulty of remote-working and especially remote-managing, there were some strategic mistakes we made, and while fixing it together, I started to think, um, again, they don't need me. (It turned out they still needed me, but not as a full-time, so I was converted to an advisor.)

And also it was end of 2022 - early 2023. What has happeend?

ChatGPT.

Oh. It was too much. The hype felt too much at the beginning, and it was too impressive as soon as I tried it out. Too good. Too revolutionary.

And I realized I may need to take a pause on my music research career. I think we were on stuck. Well, at least I was on stuck, in music research. Oh and wow.

So I decided I should learn LLM.

And that's how I joined Genentech, to train LLMs.

## Genentech.

I won't rewrite a summary of [my time at Genentech](2025-10-15-leaving-genentech.md).

## Ok, so what?

What was all the hopping around about? Through all these changes, there's something,.. there must be something constant. Something I've had thorugh all the time. Learning, proving myself, trying to find my work (and the time I spend on it) meaningful. This is what I'm trying to identify, as explicitly as possible, to explain myself and make the best decision in the future.

And wow, this is the end of my Roffice hour series. Thanks for reading.
