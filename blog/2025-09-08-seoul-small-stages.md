# Seoul’s Small-Stage Music Spaces: Jazz & Experimental Gems

As a proud author of [an unsolicited and successful (correlation or causation?) gourmet guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5KhuVMiZrvxVB9fi-pemt4hYRLcc4UrPi2FZ2qv_60/edit?tab=t.0) to ICASSP 2024 attendees, I decided to introduce some cool music venues and events aiming for the ISMIR 2025 attendees. Is it a scope of General Chair's duty? Possibly maybe..

## Jazz Venues

Daily shows with a cozy, artist-centered vibe. One of the few places where any jazz musicians can play their originals. I also see Sounddog as a K-version of Smalls, the now legendary jazz venue in NYC. Highly recommended. It doesn't have any established booking system, you just need to text the owner to book the ticket. Check out their youtube! They livestream everything, every day.

A three-day autumn jazz festival blending music, nature, and relaxed vibes.
